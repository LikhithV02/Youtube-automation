# YouTube Automation

Automate the creation of YouTube videos from a simple topic idea, like "Spiderman origin." This project harnesses AI and web research to generate a complete video, including a storyline, images, narration, and subtitlesâ€”all stitched together with MoviePy.

## Sample Output

Below is a sample video generated by this project using the topic **"Spiderman origin"**:

## Features

- **Web Research**: Employs the Tavily API to craft compelling storylines.
- **Metadata Generation**: Produces video metadata stored in a JSON file.
- **Scene Creation**: Breaks the storyline into individual scenes.
- **Prompt Generation**: Creates detailed prompts for images and narration.
- **Asset Generation**: Generates images and audio using AI tools.
- **Video Compilation**: Combines assets into a final video with zoom effects and subtitles using MoviePy.

## How It Works

1. **Input a Topic**: Start with a topic (e.g., "Spiderman origin").
2. **Research and Storyline**: Uses web research to build a storyline.
3. **Metadata and Scenes**: Generates metadata and splits the storyline into scenes.
4. **Prompts and Assets**: Creates prompts and generates images and narration.
5. **Compile Video**: Stitches everything into a polished video.

## System Requirements

- **Python 3.10 or higher**
- **FFmpeg** (required for MoviePy audio and video processing)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LikhithV02/Youtube-automation.git
   ```

2. **Set Up Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration

To run this project, you need the following API keys as prerequisites:

- **OpenAI API**: Used for text generation and decision-making.
  - Sign up at [OpenAI](https://openai.com) to obtain your API key.
- **Replicate API**: Used for generating images with the flux-schnell model.
  - Get your API key from [Replicate](https://replicate.com).
- **Eleven Labs API**: Used for generating narration audio.
  - Sign up at [Eleven Labs](https://elevenlabs.io) to get your API key.
- **Tavily API**: Used for web research to build the storyline.
  - Sign up at [Tavily](https://tavily.com) to obtain your API key.

Set up your environment variables using the provided `.env.example` file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` to include your actual API keys:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
REPLICATE_API_KEY=your_replicate_api_key_here
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key_here
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key_here
```

**Note**: Keep your `.env` file secure and do not commit it to version control. The `.gitignore` file already excludes `.env`.

## Usage

Run the main script with your desired topic:

```python
from main import create_video_with_resume
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

topic = "Spiderman origin"
video_info = create_video_with_resume(topic=topic)
logger.info(f"Successfully created video: {video_info.file_path}")
```

## Current Challenges

- **Subtitles Overlap**: Subtitles cover most of the video; aim to limit to 1-2 lines at the bottom.
- **Audio Imbalance**: Background music overshadows narration; needs better volume balancing.
- **Font Styles**: Subtitles lack appealing typography; seeking better options.
- **Prompt Quality**: Image and narration prompts need refinement for better outputs.

## Suggestions for Improvement

- Enhance image quality with advanced AI models.
- Improve audio mixing and subtitle styling in MoviePy.
